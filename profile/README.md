# Oyen Lab: Data Analysis Branch

Welcome to the data analysis repository for Washington University in St. Louis's Oyen Lab. We are developing software programs that advance the lab's mission at the forefront of bioengineering, materials science, and healthcare.

## About Oyen Lab

At the Oyen Lab, we are at the epicenter of innovation, where the realms of bioengineering, materials science, and healthcare converge. Our research primarily focuses on:

1. **Bioengineering Approaches to Pregnancy and Childbirth:** Enhancing maternal and fetal health through groundbreaking bioengineering solutions.
   
2. **Mechanical Properties of Hydrogel Materials:** Investigating the mechanics of hydrogel materials, pivotal for applications in tissue engineering and drug delivery.
   
3. **Biomimetic Materials:** Pioneering the development of materials that replicate the unique properties of both hard and soft natural tissues.
   
4. **Mechanical Contributions to Pregnancy Complications:** Unraveling the mechanical underpinnings of various pregnancy complications to foster improved health outcomes for mothers and children.

Join us as we unlock new frontiers at the crossroads of engineering, biology, and healthcare. We are steadfast in our mission to leave a lasting, positive imprint on maternal and child health.
